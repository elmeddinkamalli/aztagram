# aztagram
This is the front part of the Website. I named it Aztagram, which is the copy of Instagram. In other word, I created the front-end copy of Instagram. This repository includes PSD/AI and all other Web files that designed and created all by myself. I am also planning to make this website dynamic by using PHP and other files that related to Back-end. When I finish, I going to upload that stuff too. I am doing that as a portfolio for my future plans.
