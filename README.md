# aztagram
This is the front part of the Website. I named it Aztagram, which is the copy of Instagram. In other word, I created the front-end copy of Instagram. This repository includes PSD/AI and all other Web files that designed and created all by myself. I am also planning to make this website dynamic by using PHP and other files that related to Back-end. When I'm finish, I going to upload that stuff too. I am doing that as a portfolio for my future plans.

# Update

I finished the back-end of the website and upload all files to a free server. I'm leaving the link of the website below.

Informations about website:

As I said this is the copy of Instagram and only created for the purpose of portfolio for my future plans. 

The Website includes many futures of Instagram.
-You can sign up for an account
-Login and logout
-Share posts
-Like, comment and save someone's posts
-Like someone's comments
-Follow and unfollow others
-Manage your profile (edit inofs, upload profile pics etc.)
-Message someone through direct

And additionally:
-Search,
-Live chat,
-Notifications (when message, follow, like, and comment a post) working features as well.

Like in original Instagram, here also new feeds and posts uploading when scroll to bottom of the page. Initially not all comments showing, you can view all comments of a post just by clicking "view all comments" button. Likes and comments count works as good as in original Instagram. You can also view whose likes a post, whose followes someone or followers of someone like in original Instagram.
